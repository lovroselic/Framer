Project: Framer
Python

USing a frame image, and merge it with arbitrary picture to created framed picture.

Directory 'Frames' contains frames. $outerWidth is the wifth of the image, $innerWidth is the width of the transparent part, where we will insert the picture.
Directory 'Pics' contains pictures which will be framed.
Directory 'Output' is used to save results.

Workflow:
For each picture in 'Pics'
	select picture $pic
	select random $frame from 'Frames'
	determine the $innerWidth of $frame
	resize (reduce size) of $pic so it's $width will be equal to $innerWidth
	combine $pic and $frame ($frame needs to be top layer)
	save this resulted pic in dir 'Output'
